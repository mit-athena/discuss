				  for the current user.

SYNOPSYS
     add_meeting meeting_name ... {-public} {-user {user}}

     add_meeting transaction_specifiers

DESCRIPTION
     Add_mtg makes a meeting known for the current user. 

     In the first form, meeting_name is either in the form of
     host:pathname, or is a meeting name as it is named by
     another user.  In the latter case, the -public and -user
     flags choose which user's list of meetings are used to
     find the meeting_name.

     In the second form, the transaction_specifiers refer to a set of
     meeting announcements.  A meeting annoucement is a specially
     formatted transaction generated by announce_meeting that 
     describes the meeting's location, and name.  The add_mtg
     request will use this information to add the meeting to the
     user's list of meetings.
