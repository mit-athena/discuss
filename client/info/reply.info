NAME
     reply, repl, rp - Enter a reply to an existing transaction
	(message) into a meeting.

SYNOPSYS
     reply transaction_specifier [-editor name] [-meeting name]
	[-no_editor] [-subject]

DESCRIPTION
     Reply allows one to enter a reply to an existing transaction.  If
     no transaction specifier is given, the transaction replied to is
     the current transaction (the last one printed).

     If the DISCUSS_EDITOR environment variable is set, then it will
     fork a subprocess to run the program named in the environment
     variable. When the editor is finished, it reads in the file and
     appends it to the meeting as a new transaction, setting the
     "pref" and "nref" link it to the transaction it is a reply to.
     By default, the subject field is set to be "Re: " prepended
     to the subject of the message being replied to.

     If the DISCUSS_EDITOR environment variable is not set, Discuss
     prompts for the transaction input directly.  When entering
     the transaction, typing "\f" or "~e" on a line by itself will
     fork a subprocess to run the editor specified by the EDITOR
     environment variable.  Typing "~v" on a line by itself will fork
     a subprocess to run the editor specified by the VISUAL environment
     variable.  When the editor is finished, Discuss reads the file and
     appends it to the meeting as a new transaction, setting the "pref"
     and "nref" links and the subject field as above.

OPTIONS
     -editor specifies another editor to use instead of the default.

     -meeting causes the reply to be entered into the named meeting, rather
	than the current one.

     -no_editor causes the transaction to be taken from standard input,
        with no editing allowed.

     -subject causes the user to be prompted for a new subject.  The
	transaction will still be chained to the original, but with a
	different subject.

FILES
     /tmp/mtg%d.%d     Temporary file for use with editor
