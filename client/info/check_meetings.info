NAME
     check_meetings, ckm - Check for changed meetings

SYNOPSYS
     ckm {meeting_names} [-no_list]

DESCRIPTION
     Check_meetings is used to check what meetings have changed, so that
     next_meeting can be used to advance from one meeting to another.

     Typically, a user wants to attend all changed meetings so he can
     read the new transactions.  To do this, he can use check_meetings
     to find out what meetings have changed,  and then issue
     next_meeting to goto the first changed meeting.  He can then
     print out the new transactions, and then issue next_meeting to
     visit the second changed meeting, and so on until no more
     changed meetings are left.

OPTIONS
     -no_list (-nls)
	Don't display the list of meetings which have changed.
