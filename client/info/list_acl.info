NAME
     list_acl, la - List the access control list of this meeting.

SYNOPSYS
     list_acl [principal ... ]

DESCRIPTION
     list_acl either prints the entire access control list (if called
     with no arguments), or lists the access given to each principal 
     name given on the command line.  See access(discuss) for 
     information on interpreting access modes.

SEE ALSO
     discuss(1), access(discuss), set_acl(discuss), delete_acl(discuss)

DIAGNOSTICS
     Insufficient access for operation.
	Insufficient access to list the given access.  List_acl
	requires status (s) access on the meeting to list its
	access control list.

BUGS
     It should be possible to enter principal names without a realm
     attached and have them default to the local realm.
